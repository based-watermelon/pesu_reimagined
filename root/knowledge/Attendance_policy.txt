PES University (PESU) mandates a minimum attendance of 80% to 85% in every subject to be eligible for end-semester examinations. While 85% is often the standard requirement, it can be condoned down to 75% for genuine medical reasons or representing the university. Attendance is tracked on a per-subject basis, not just daily. 

Key Aspects of the PESU Attendance Policy:
Minimum Requirement: 80-85% in each subject is required to sit for End Semester Assessments (ESA).
Condonation: Attendance may be condoned down to 75% for valid medical reasons or representing the university in, for example, sports or cultural activities.
Consequences: Attendance below 75% may result in debarment from exams, and falling below 85% might require signing documents, submitting medical certificates, or meeting with authorities.
Tracking: Students can track their attendance through the PESU App or specifically designed tools like the PESU Attendance Chrome extension.
Makeup Classes: The university may offer makeup classes for attendance shortages, but this facility is generally allowed only once during the entire program.
First Day: Attendance on the first day is typically mandatory.
