PES University is known for its "zero-tolerance" approach to exam malpractice. Here are the core guidelines for the ISA (In-Semester Assessment) and ESA (End-Semester Assessment):
Attendance Requirement
The 85% Rule: You must maintain a minimum of 85% attendance in each subject to be eligible to sit for the ESA.
Condonation: In extreme medical cases, a small relaxation may be granted at the discretion of the Vice-Chancellor, but it is not guaranteed.
Entry & Timing
Reporting: Students must be outside the exam hall at least 20–30 minutes before the start time.
Late Entry: No student is allowed to enter the hall after the exam has officially commenced (usually a 15-minute grace period at most).
Early Exit: You generally cannot leave the hall until at least half the duration of the exam has passed.
Mandatory Carry-ons
ID Card & Admit Card: You cannot enter the hall without your physical University ID card and the printed Hall Ticket/Admit Card.
Stationery: You must bring your own pens, pencils, and erasers. Sharing is strictly prohibited.
Prohibited Items & Electronics
Smart Devices: Mobile phones, smartwatches, Bluetooth devices, and programmable calculators are strictly banned.
Bags: All bags and personal belongings must be left in a designated area outside the exam room.
Calculators: Only non-programmable scientific calculators are allowed (and only for specific subjects).
Malpractice Policy
Possession vs. Use: Even the mere possession of a mobile phone or a piece of paper (crib sheet) inside the hall—regardless of whether you used it—is treated as malpractice.
Consequences: If caught, the "Malpractice Committee" usually cancels all papers for that entire semester, and the student may face suspension.
Answer Scripts
Details: You must ensure your SRN (Student Registration Number) and other details are filled correctly on the OMR/front sheet.
Tearing: Tearing pages from the main answer booklet or supplements is a serious offence.
