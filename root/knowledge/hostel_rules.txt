PES University has a reputation for being quite disciplined. Here are the standard hostel rules and regulations across both the RR and EC campuses: 
General Conduct & Timing
Curfew: Students must usually be inside the hostel by 9:00 PM or 9:30 PM. Entry after this requires prior permission or a valid reason (like a late-night lab session).
Biometrics: Most hostels use biometric attendance systems to track entry and exit.
Attendance: Regular attendance in classes is linked to hostel stay; chronic absentees may be asked to vacate. 
Prohibited Items & Activities
Zero Tolerance: Use or possession of tobacco, alcohol, or any prohibited substances results in immediate expulsion.
Appliances: High-power electrical items like heaters, induction stoves, or air conditioners are generally not allowed in standard rooms.
Ragging: PES maintains a strict anti-ragging policy; any involvement leads to permanent suspension from the university. 
Visitors & Leaves
Guests: Outside guests and day scholars are strictly prohibited from entering the hostel rooms. Parents can meet students in the designated visitor area/lobby.
Night Outs: To stay out overnight, you must obtain a "Leave of Absence" through the online portal, which usually requires OTP verification or email approval from your parents. 
Facilities & Maintenance
Room Care: Students are responsible for the furniture provided. Any damage is deducted from the caution deposit.
Quiet Hours: Strict silence must be maintained after 11:00 PM to ensure a conducive environment for study. 
Dining
Mess Timing: Meals are served only during specific windows. Food is typically not allowed to be carried back to the rooms.
